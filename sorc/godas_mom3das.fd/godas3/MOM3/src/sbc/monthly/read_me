                               MONTHLY


     this "atmos" interpolates time dependent surface boundary
     conditions which have been prepared from the MOM climatological
     database (using the run scripts in PREP_DATA) to the time step
     level required by MOM.

     note: boundary conditions are monthly means which must have been
     prepared prior to this for the current configuration of MOM using
     the database programs supplied. as an illustration for generality
     in data assimilation situations, each S.B.C is treated
     separately.  for example, this allows for a mixture of monthly
     heatflux with daily winds. the default case assumes, however, that
     all S.B.C are monthly.
