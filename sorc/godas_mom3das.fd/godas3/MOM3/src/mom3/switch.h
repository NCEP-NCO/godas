!====================== include file "switch.h" ========================
!
!     all time dependent decisions are made by time manager "tmngr.F"
!     and communicated elsewhere to the model via logical switches.
!
!     inputs: (defaulted in "blkdta.F", optionally reset via namelist)
!
!
!     runlen  = integration period (see rununits). note "runlen" should
!               be an integral number of density time steps. if not,
!               then "runlen" is automatically adjusted to insure this.
!               fractional days are supported but not fractional months
!               or years.
!     rununits= units of "runlen". may be "days", "months", or "years".
!               tmngr will convert "runlen" which is in "rununits"
!               to "rundays" in units of days.
!
!     segtim  = the integration time "runlen" is broken into a number of
!               segments each of length "segtim" days. updated surface
!               boundary conditions are applied to MOM every "segtim" 
!               days. this is useful when coupling to atmospheric models
!               in which case both models exchange surface boundary
!               conditions every "segtim" days where "segtim"
!               is 1/(coupling frequency). without an atmospheric model,
!               when getting surface boundary conditions from data, 
!               "segtim" is set to the time step (in days) by mom.F. in
!               either case, "runlen" (in days) should be an integral
!               number of "segtim".     
!
!     nmix    = number of time steps between mixing timesteps. used
!               to damp timestep splitting due to centered leapfrog.
!
!     init    = (true,false)  indicates that this run is a
!               (start from initial conditions, restart)
!
!     restrt  = (true,false) = (do,don`t) write a restart at the end
!               of the run
!
!     eb      = (true,false) configures for the use of a 
!               (euler backward,forward) type mixing timestep

!     inputs to tmngr.F: diagnostic intervals
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!     note: switches are used to control the interval between doing
!           diagnostics. units for all switches are in days. 
!           setting a switch < 0.0 disables its diagnostic 
!           setting a switch = 0.0 causes the diagnostic to be 
!           done every time step, and setting a switch > 0.0 causes the
!           diagnostic to be done repeatedly at the specified interval
!           from a specified starting date.

!               not necessary to keep writing a time independent field

!
!     timavgint= interval (days) for writing time mean data

!     each averaging period switch needs four variables in common. The 
!     following naming convention is used.
!
!         1) an interval (real) for diagnostic output    (e.g. xbtint  )
!         2) a switch (logical) for the interval         (e.g. xbtts   )
!         3) an averaging period (real)                  (e.g. xbtper  )
!         4) a switch (logical) for accumulating         (e.g. xbtperts)
!
!
!     The user must specify the interval [e.g., xbtint] for diagnostic
!     output in units of days and the averaging period [e.g., xbtper] 
!     in units of days. The averaging period may be less than or equal
!     to the interval. For example, if the interval is 30.0 days and the
!     averaging period is 5.0 days, results will be averaged over all
!     time steps within days 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30. An averaging period
!     of 0.0 days averages over the last time step of the interval (as
!     does xbtper = dt), and an averaging period less than zero turns
!     the switches off for all time steps.  
!
!     The logical switch for writing output at the specified interval 
!     [e.g., xbtts] is set to true on the last time step of the 
!     averaging period. The logical switch for accumulating results
!     [e.g., xbtperts] is true for all time steps within the averaging
!     period, otherwise it is false.
