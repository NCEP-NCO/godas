			    read_me for MOM_3

=======================================================================
ALL FILES IN THIS FTP DIRECTORY ARE PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS. WHEN THIS 
MESSAGE IS REMOVED, THE FILES WILL BE THE FINAL VERSIONS.
=======================================================================



* The basic run_script included with MOM_3 is "run_mom" which is
  specific for a CRAY T90. Since we do not have access to all platforms at
  GFDL, we cannot offer advice on making scripts work on other 
  platforms.

* To compile correctly, it is necessary to have option -F on the
  list of compiler options in all Cray run scripts. On SGI with MipsPro
  compilers, use -ftpp -macro_expand. On other systems use the
  equivalent compiler flags for global macro expansions.


* For details about mpp modules, look at Balaji's web site:
  www.gfdl.gov/~vb

* OS dependent ifdefs have been converted to cpp macros that are
  guaranteed by the compiler. Refer to www/gfdl.gov/~vb/os.html
  for more details.

* If there are problems with NetCDF, then make sure that the
  "udunits.dat" and "netcdf.inc" files are copied into the working
  directory (before compiling) as is done in the run_mom script.

* For NetCDF output, NetCDF library v3.4 or later is required

* A user has reported that MOM 3 runs on a DEC Alpha Workstation
   with DEC F90 compiler after making the following changes:
   
 
    1)  Add " convert='big_endian' " to "open" statement in files iomngr.F, 
        sbc.F and ic.F
     
    2)  Change .F90 extensions to .F and compile these files with
        COMPILE_OPTION -free -w -c
        Compile all other files with options: -c
